mc,A SNP Detection Problem,"You are using a microarray to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in samples from multiple people.  For a given site you wish to 
compare two hypotheses: \(H_1\), a SNP is present in the population
(i.e. there is genetic variation at this site); \(H_0\), no SNP
is present.  The microarray gives a fluorescence observation \(X\)
for a given sample, and you are given likelihoods
\(p(X|\kappa)\) for the possible number of copies of the variant
in that sample \(\kappa=0,1,...2N\), where \(N\) is the number
of people pooled in that sample.  You are also given the two
models \(p(\kappa|H_1,N), p(\kappa|H_0,N)\), and the prior ratio
\(p(H_1)/p(H_0)\).  

Given \(X\) measurements for multiple samples as your *obs*, 
can you compute the posterior odds ratio \(p(H_1|obs)/p(H_0|obs)\)?","Yes, just sum over all possible values of \(\kappa\).

",0,0,"Yes, the data are sufficient. ","No, the \(\kappa\) values are unknown.",It depends.
text,Summation Equalities,"Assume that a random variable \(B\) has disjoint possible values
\(\{b_1, \ldots, b_n\}\).
Which of the following expressions if any are equal?

1. \(\sum_{i=1}^n p(A|B=b_i)\).
2. \(\sum_{i=1}^n p(A, B=b_i)\).
3. \(\sum_{i=1}^n p(A|B=b_i)p(B=b_i)\).
4. \(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{p(A)}{p(B=b_i)}\).
5. \(\sum_{i=1}^n p(A)p(B=b_i)\).
6. \(p(A)\)
7. \(p(B)\)","2, 3, 5, 6",3,"Beware of summing over the condition of a conditional probability!!
This is a common error.","Many people realized 2 and 3 were equal, because \(p(A,B)=p(A|B)p(B)\),
but then didn't see the connection to 5, 6 (\(p(A)\)).  This
implies they didn't realize that summing over *B* eliminates it from
the probability expression.

This is a *really* important tool.  It allows you to properly handle
a hidden variable that links what you know (obs) and what you want
to know (some other hidden variable).  Just sum over all possible
values of this ""nuisance variable"" and eliminate it from the equation!!","Some people assumed A,B were independent, contrary to what the question
asked.
