<H1>Image Upload Instructions</H1>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<LI>Use the software supplied by your laptop's manufacturer to take
    a snapshot with your webcam and save it as a file.  There is no
    need to use a resolution higher than about 1 megapixel.
<LI>Back in your browser, click the File Upload button and
    choose your snapshot from wherever you saved it.</LI>

<h2>Mac</h2>
<LI>Launch the <B>Photo Booth</B> application.</LI>
<LI>Make sure on the <B>Edit</B> menu that 
    <I>Auto Flip New Photos</I> is <B>checked</B>.</LI>
<LI>Hold up your answer to the webcam so it fills the Photo Booth
    preview window, and click the snapshot button.</LI>
<LI>The new snapshot will appear in the "library" strip at the bottom of
    the Photo Booth window.  Drag the snapshot onto your desktop.
    Note its name (it'll be something like "Photo on 2011-...").</LI>
<LI>Back in your browser, click the File Upload button and
    choose your snapshot file from the Desktop folder.</LI>

<h2>Android</h2>
<B>Not really recommended, because most Android phones have high
resolution cameras which create huge image files.  Uploading a huge
image file will significantly slow down our in-class response server.</B>

<LI>Use your phone's camera to take a picture of your answer.</LI>
<LI>Back in your browser, click the File Upload button and
    choose your snapshot from the image gallery.</LI>
<LI>Before you click the Go button to submit your file,
    call out "Bombs away!  I'm about to upload a big file so
    I suggest everyone else hold off submitting your answers
    until this upload completes..."</LI>
<LI>When your upload completes, call out "All done!"</LI>
